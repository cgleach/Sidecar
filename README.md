Data analysis for SC

Purpose of code is to import a csv file, manipulate the data, and create a simple view.  In this case, I graphed the 
weighted conversion rate of each site, placed into quartile buckets.  This view demonstrates the trend for larger sites by website views 
to have on average higher conversion rates.
